#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
1. All unique cities where customers are located.
2. Count the number of orders placed in 2017
3. Find the total sales per category
4. Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments
5. Count the number of customers from each state
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
1. Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018
